# Currency Converter

Alura Latam Challenge

This project was proposed by Alura Latam as part of the Oracle Next Education (ONE) program, aims to apply concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), API consumption, JSON library management, and exception handling. It consists of a currency converter with a set number of currencies to choose from, executed from the console. For example, you can convert from US dollars (USD) to Argentine pesos (ARS). The program will provide conversion information and a log history of the conversions made by the user. The Exchange Rate API was used for real-time exchange rates.
